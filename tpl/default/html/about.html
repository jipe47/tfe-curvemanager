<h1>About</h1>

<p>The <strong>Curve Predictor Project</strong> is a part of a master thesis on machine learning. The goal is to evalute the humans' capacity to predict time series and compare it to supervised algorithms. It also aims to find if humans are more accurate than machines for certain kinds of series or vice versa.</p>
<br />
<p>In order to motivate volunteers to participate in the project, an Android application has been developped and interacts with users in the form of a game. They perform predictions and compete through a score: the more accurate they are, the more points they win. The application has been designed for a smartphone format and will be adapted to Android tablets; no Iphone or Ipad version is planned.</p>
<br />
<p>Time serie predictions are gathered and analysed on this server. Data are compared to determine whether humans or algorithms are the best at predicting time series. These curves are splitted in different categories: macro, micro, industry, finance and demographic.</p>
